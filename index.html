                        <h2>IT Technology in India</h2>
                        <p>There’s no doubt that the world will drastically change with technology and innovation in the next 20 years. And as a stakeholder in an IT company, it’s crucial to know which technologies to implement so your business can stay ahead of the competition and generate significant profits.</p>
                        <p class="sub-heading">Artificial Intelligence & Robotics</p>
						<p>Though the concept of Artificial Intelligence is well over 60 years old, it has only become popular in the last decade. With passive operational power and storage, AI can transform business strategies like no other. Self-driving cars, robotics, new teaching methods, and even personalised medicines – AI is set to take over, and take over it will.</p>
						<p class="sub-heading">Augmented Reality</p>
						<p>Augmented reality is no longer science-fiction, thanks to the IT technological advancements in the last decade. While earlier, the costs associated with AR meant that projects were few and far apart, today, technology has made it possible for AR to be available even on the mobile handset. In the future, Augmented Reality will find its application in education, art, architecture, military, and navigation – the possibilities are truly endless.</p>

                        <ul class="ulclass"><li>India’s demographic dividend and a sharp rise in working population would be some of the contributing factors that would enable the country to achieve projected GDP of USD 9 trillion and per capita income of USD 5,625 by 2030.</li>
						<li>By 2030, urban India will account for nearly 75% of the GDP and Indian cities will act as engines of economic growth for the country’s built environment.</li>
						<li>The Indian economic transition and workforce expansion will also offer vast development and investment opportunities for the real estate sector.</li>
						<li>On the other hand, a high density of population and fast-paced economic growth has made India extremely susceptible to climate change; however, the country is working towards minimising this impact by launching several green initiatives at the national, state and local level.</li>
						<li>Technology is also fundamentally changing the way Indians live and work. By 2025, the digital economy is expected to account for approximately 18-23% of the total GDP.</li></ul>

                        <h2>The Impact of Climate Change</h2>
                        <p>India is both a major greenhouse gas emitter and one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to projected climate change. The country is already experiencing changes in climate and the impacts of climate change, including water stress, heat waves and drought, severe storms and flooding, and associated negative consequences on health and livelihoods. With a 1.2 billion but growing population and dependence on agriculture, India probably will be severely impacted by continuing climate change. Global climate projections, given inherent uncertainties, indicate several changes in India’s future climate.</p>
						<ul class="ulclass"><li>Global observations of melting glaciers suggest that climate change is well under way in the region, with glaciers receding at an average rate of 10–15 meters per year. If the rate increases, flooding is likely in river valleys fed by these glaciers, followed by diminished flows, resulting in water scarcity for drinking and irrigation.</li>
						<li>All models show a trend of general warming in mean annual temperature as well as decreased range of diurnal temperature and enhanced precipitation over the Indian subcontinent. A warming of 0.5o C is likely over all India by the year 2030 (approximately equal to the warming over the 20th century) and a warming of 2-4o C by the end of this century, with the maximum increase over northern India. Increased warming is likely to lead to higher levels of tropospheric ozone pollution and other air pollution in the major cities.</li></ul>
